Guidelines:
- Always fetch complete records rather than partial data when possible
- Use date filters appropriately when temporal data is requested
- Apply business unit, status, or other categorical filters as needed
- If a query is ambiguous, fetch broader data sets rather than being too restrictive
- Return data in a structured format (JSON preferred)
- Include relevant metadata when available
