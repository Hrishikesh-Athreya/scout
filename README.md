Give me a simple flow that takes in user input -> uses the db agent to fetch the rows that are needed -> saves those rows and data to temp local sqlite tables for later use -> takes the table names and the schema from the sqlite table to generate an sql query based on the users query -> fetches the required data and then deletes the temp tables and returns the output of the query[](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/multi_agent/agent_supervisor/)
```


```
Give me the agent.py and tools.json for a comms agent that sends messages using these apis as tools. It should figure out who to send it to and handle multiple recipients if needed. Send multiple calls if needed to send to all recipients. Mix and match email and slack as needed.

Give me the agent.py and tools.json for a docs/report generation agent that uses this api as a tool with optional parameters if needed. We supply it with a prompt to generate a report on and some data, it has to figure out the rest, put in the format the api expects and call the api to get the report back, in the api body if we arent using any fields, keep them empyty

Now I want a supervisor.py that gets a query for a report and where/who to send it. It plans out which of the agents to call and in what order to get the data from the db and then send it to the right people. It should use the db agent to get the data, then use the docs agent to generate a report on that data, then use the comms agent to send that report to the right people. It should handle errors and stop if any agent fails and return the error message.
```


üöÄInspiration
While working in enterprises like PayPal, Oracle, and Navi, we saw firsthand how much time and money teams lose to reporting overhead. Across engineering, product, and business teams, thousands of hours are wasted every year on one-off data requests, status checks, and report generation. Engineers lose focus context-switching to run ad-hoc queries, analysts get buried under repetitive asks, and product managers wait days for answers to simple questions. The result: bottlenecks, slower decisions, and stalled momentum.

That‚Äôs why we built Scout, your AI Business Intelligence Teammate. Scout lives in Slack and understands plain English, so anyone can query data, explore metrics, or generate insights without SQL or waiting in line. ‚ÄúJust ask Scout‚Äù and unblock your team to focus on building, analyzing, and innovating

What it does
Scout empowers engineering, product, and business teams with natural language data access, seamless reporting, and secure delivery, all from within Slack.

Key features :
1. Natural Language Data Querying No SQL. No schema knowledge. Just ask in plain English. Scout leverages connected MCP servers to understand context and retrieve the right data instantly, freeing employees from database complexity.

2. Report Generation & Security Turn raw data into professional, shareable reports in seconds. With built-in encryption and password protection, sensitive information stays secure.

3. Omnichannel Delivery Share insights where your team works. Scout delivers reports directly to Slack or email ‚Äî whether for teammates, stakeholders, or external partners.
